Hi,

This is my first (beginner) project page, built from scratch and using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I also used a handful of libraries to introduce essential functionality.

The site is available to be visited, as well as the code viewable from the source branch. The link to visit is: https://joeymonachino.github.io/smitesociety/

There is a landing page with an Enter button. Once you enter, you will see a generic description of my goals and explanations.

The Randomizer page implements a javascript function to obtain random characters and items from a list and ensure they are the correct type for that character. 
The logic is not complex by any means, but it functions how I intended it to.

The Tierlist implements drag and drop libraries for responsive interaction. You can drag and drop the names into whatever tier you see fit.

The code here is not pretty, and it definitely looks like a beginner has done it. 
This was just my foundation and I am looking to build upon this and also work on some other projects, 
all the while making my code more clean and neat (and complex).

Thank you for taking the time to look through my project.
